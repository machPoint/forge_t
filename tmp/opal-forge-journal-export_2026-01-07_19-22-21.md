<p>So, is it fair? So, I feel like it isn't fair, which is very different from it being fair. So objectively why do I feel that it is unfair? So, let's look at the situation. I was hired into a role which I had done, Systems Engineer, I knew ho to use Haa and for ECLSS components, something I was familiar with, that went ok, no issues and I had a decent review. Then moved from ECLSS, and let's talk about the PTW role, specifically, moved from ECLSS and told to run the PTW Effort, with no experience in Electrical, no experience with thermal and little experience with Water and especially the combination of these systems. And I was just told to run it, even through Thermal was running their ownpart of it, ECS was running their own part of it and water had no real ability to control what those systems did. Not to mention that these other systems had been already working on this effort for a full DAC and the people working those were experienced for at least a year. So, was it fair, maybe. And now in hindsight I realized what I could've done better. I should've elevated it, I didn't know the details of the systems, but what I should have done is get access to LEAT to run the analysis, or at least asked the LEAT person to do the analysis, come together for an hour, or half hour a week and elevated above the systems to the PTW system. simply as for inputs, get updates on the opportunities and threats and then look at, or create the analyses and show how each of the efforts, combined, reflected in the power, thermal, eater reduction and managed it at a higher level and reported it back to them so that each knew where the other program was. So was it it fair, maybe, but it was fair to me. In other words, coming from a role that didn't require presentations, didn't require making tickets, didn't require even talking to anyone other than my boss and then doing this. But, it's not about me, and that's what I have an issue with, it's not about people here, we are just engineering units doing a job. And, maybe that 's what it takes.</p><p><br></p><p>It's strange, I could've gone for walks, thought about this for a few more weeks and never have gotten past the fact that I didn't feel it was fair, and lived in my resentment but on writing through it, I discovered that what I should've done was something, I could've done, if I had the will and acknowledged the reality beyond the feeling of unfairness.</p>

# High Trust

<p>Reflecting on your experience in the Systems Engineer role, what specific factors contribute to your perception of fairness or unfairness in your professional environment, and how can you navigate these feelings to foster a more balanced perspective?</p><p><br></p><p>I'm trying to think through this but there are things that I have noticed at work, behavior that I initially thought were female coded behavior but now I'm seeing a behavior that is from low trust societies. Behavior, in an engineering profession, like taking credit fo rothers work, not revealing risk or assumptions, looking out for oneself and working against the team if it benefits the person. There is just a fair amount of deception and manipulation, it's far different than the world that I know where risks and assumptions are the first thing you announce, you give people credit and you work to bring the team up, not tear others down at your expense. And so, it is disheartening to realize this, and even more difficult to work in it. The people that are the loudest, that sell rather than engineer, that manipulate rather than produce actual results are the ones rewarded. If you can talk yourself up, if you can ask questions in meetings, just to get your name out there then you are doing better than those that are doing the actual work. That is not to say that I'm doing any better than them, I am not, not in this position but I can't help that I will not survive in this environment. I want the risks to be known, even if it temporarily hurts a persons feelings. The job is more performative than it actual work, actual rigorous engineering. Am I seeing this clearly?</p>

# Fair Decisions

<p>So, I'm not sure that I had much choice but to apply to my old job, well my old employer at least. It doesn't seem fair to put someone an a coaching plan 2 months fater they started a new job, one they've never had on a system they haven't worked with performing tasks they've never done. I could think of it charitably that there is a desire for me to get better but, that's not something I want to bet my income on. And, seeing how this company, and especially the parent company treats their employees I can see how it's going to go and I'll have to endure the constant threat of being fired. It's Ok though, I'm kind of tired of seemingly living some lie where I'm supposed to be that excited about space, and I am, and it felt good to say I'm working on moon landers but do I really care, not really. That's just not me. At least, the hard core, engineer isn't me. That's not to say I couldn't find a place but it appears that this is not how it's going to happen. The issue now, is finding another job. I suppose I should be sufficiently scared, and I am, especially with my current housing issues but I feel that it will work out, eventually. Am I not sufficiently worried or am I oblivious to the risk. If I have a month I could be in trouble., so I need to get my shit done and done well. And perform, or rather be performative in my engineering, which requires good days, well slept, well informed and making good decisions. No guessing.</p><p><br></p><p>So, how did I get here. It was a bad combination of events, my own personal shit of not being where I want in life, being thrown around in a job, but not fired, and then getting thrown into a position that I had no business being in. And so, what were the beliefs? I think mostly they are that I can't do it, I have no courage and no confidence in my abilities and for some reason i give up, just in time where it's time to put something out in to the world, Where does this come from? It's like there is a part of me that wants to protect my fragile self-confidence, which isn't really there and live in some delusion that I can do anything and I will, eventually but I can't seem to direct myself in on the correct vector and work to compete what I need to get done.</p>

Michael, I notice you’re navigating a complex web of professional and personal uncertainties. There's a palpable tension in your narrative between capability and confidence, and between your current reality and what you desire or expect from yourself.

One possible belief that emerges is a sense of inadequacy or self-doubt in your professional capabilities, particularly in unfamiliar situations. You describe a lack of confidence and courage, which seems to clash with your underlying self-perception that you should be able to do anything eventually. This might point to a hidden belief that unless you're perfect or performing at a peak level, you're somehow not enough.

There’s also a theme of external pressures and standards—feeling like you must be "performative" in your role, embodying an ideal engineer, even when it doesn't quite resonate with who you truly are. This suggests a possible belief that your value is tied to external validation or achievement, and that misalignment might be contributing to your current dissatisfaction.

You mention enduring threats of job loss and questioning your genuine interest in your work, which could reflect an underlying belief that stability comes at the cost of authenticity. Perhaps there's a fear that pursuing what truly interests you is too risky.

Your reflection on how you got here highlights a struggle with self-direction and commitment, a "lack of courage and no confidence" when facing tasks. This might suggest a deeper belief that failing to meet expectations is safer than trying and potentially failing publicly.

I invite you to explore these thoughts further: What would your career look like if you truly embraced your authentic interests? What might happen if you viewed challenges as opportunities to grow, rather than threats to your self-worth? Consider journaling on these prompts to delve deeper into these beliefs and where they might have originated.

<p>So, this work issue is bring other thing into focus and it's not pleasant but, it is something to work on if I want to live in a reasonably autonomous manner. And, I'm not really sure what it is, but here's a symptom. I can't finish any thing. I have what 8 projects that are all in various phases of being competed, one is sitting there in Android Studio just waiting to be tested and launched and I can't seem to do it. I just started another project, after starting two more this weekend an I can come up with ideas and projects but I cannot finish them. I can't finish my degree, I can't finish my work, I need to figure out why I can't finish things.</p>

# The Other Side of Reality

<p>Do you remember that time, on My. Quandry, when you were the last person on the mountain, a 14'er, and a storm started to roll in and there was snow. Without distraction, without forced attention you could see what being alone tryly meant. There was no song, no sitcom, no alternate humanity that could rest as your fill-in for another person, another friend, it was only you on the side of that moutain, alone with that feeling of complete abondonment as you looked upon an empty valley and nothing but the reality of your existence is solitude. That is tis feeling, the feeling of reality, laid bare and exposoed for you to act upon.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time to find that reality again now, you know that you are not thehardest worker, the smartest person with the most charm can slide by on some personality and minimal effort, you can do that no longer for that is why you find yourslef here. At 3 AM, heart racing as the reality of years of half-assed work, measuring yourslef among those that offer no inspiration, only solice in your false superiority. It is time to fnd that reality upon that mountain, that you must work, that you must find, not motivation but discipline. that you must work hard, that you must study, that you must accept the reality of this positiona nd you must concentrate on your position on who you have become and how others see you. It is not faborable and they are justified in viewing you that way.</p><p><br></p><p>And so you must accept you solitude and find a way back or this will be an unmanageable position. You might not know where to turn or what to do in order to save your job, in order to save your future but you know that you can read about work, you can study the systems, you can not pretend to be an engineer, that you can read the textbooks, that you can succeed, or at least not falter to the point that you find yourslef in financial ruin. I do not know where this sadow lies, te one that for some reason refuses to let you work hard, that let's you play by others rules, you are not agoing to sit in quiet resentment as you are cast aside you can become good at what seek, you can find those answers that are int he quiet ends of those meetings, you can contribute and idon't know where this came from this abondment of myslef, that I can no longer function or choose not to and not become productive as some fight against 'the system', but it connot be done froma aplace of weakness. I will no longer fail and seek solace in planned revenge that does not happen. Strip bare the layered distractions of a moments feeling that hides the situation you are in. And work towards something in order to finish it and perservere. Bring those demons to the fore and do not let that sheltered ego falsely rest.</p>



## AI Feedback

Michael, your journal entry reveals a powerful moment of self-awareness and a desire for transformation. There's a deep yearning for authenticity and a rejection of the illusions that have kept you from confronting certain truths about yourself.

One pattern that stands out is the tension between solitude and connection. You describe a moment on the mountain where solitude revealed a stark reality. This might point to a belief that true understanding or clarity can only be found in isolation, away from the "distractions" of others. Yet, there's also a desire for connection, or at least for recognition and respect from others, which seems to be causing internal conflict.

Another theme is the struggle with self-discipline and perceived inadequacy. There's a sense of urgent self-critique, where you oscillate between acknowledging past complacency and urging yourself to embrace a more disciplined approach. This might suggest an underlying belief that your worth is tied to your productivity and achievements, and perhaps a fear that you are not measuring up to your potential or the expectations of others.

You also mention a sense of "abandonment of self" and a fight against "the system," hinting at a deeper internal battle. This could reflect an unconscious rule that says conformity means losing your identity, or that external validation comes at the cost of personal authenticity.

A compassionate reflection might be: What if the solitude you seek doesn't have to mean isolation from others or harsh self-criticism? What if it could be a space where you integrate both discipline and self-compassion, acknowledging your imperfections while also valuing your efforts?

Consider exploring these journaling prompts:

- What would it look like to find clarity and reality without needing to be isolated on a mountain?
- How might your understanding of discipline change if it was rooted in curiosity and growth, rather than fear of inadequacy?
- What part of "the system" feels most at odds with your true self, and how might you navigate that tension with integrity?

It's a brave step to confront these feelings, and it's okay to approach this journey with patience and kindness towards yourself.

<p>Well after realizing that my body wasn't punishing me I realized that I was punishing my body by not doing the things I set out to do, I had not prepared and the reason for the stress is that I had pushed down all the conscious issues with tasks that I am supposed to do. I can't take on a new job, new house, life, phd, new projects, have no fun and assume that it'll be ok because in doing those things, or rather not doing them, what I am doing is distorting reality in order to function. And what happens, you end up on Mt. Quandry, free from distraction realizing how alone you are. And then you wake up from a nightmare of a centipede crawling on your arm and biting you because after pushing all those responsibilities away my wouldn't let me sleep, so I took drugs, and then my body said you need to pay attention to where you are are and what you have to do and so I will create a subconscious emergence while you are asleep to scare the shit out of you to get your attention. My subconscious is saying, 'you need to take care of your shit, and if you don't wake up and get to work, I will wake you up so that you don't abuse the subconscious with your irresponsibility'.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it worked, I immediately woke the fuck up, scared out of my mind trying to get the centipede off may arm from that nightmare. I was thinking about this in reverse and I now have to thank my subconscious self for alarming me to the situation. And I know what I must do, that is work, work harder, understand the physics, understand what the vehicle is doing, what the org is doing, sleep, so you can concentrate, offer solutions based on what you have learned, or will be learning at least and be active. And so this is the opportunity and demand from the centipede, be active, like your life is actually yours, like you have autonomy, like you have agency and push through the shit you don't want to do, but you have to do it. From taking out the trash to doing your taxes, shit has to be done if you want to live the way you want.</p><p><br></p><p>And so the question is, what do you do to remove those blocking subconscious actions, that distortion of reality so that you can ignore issues and move about the world, in a manner that does not stop you from existing? If I had to move my subconscious world into the forefront, it would prevent all forward movement. Is there a balance? Is there a healthy way to do this? Maybe it's as simple as starting, look at my taxes, I have 10 days to do them and the first ting to do is start. Create a desktop folder, put in the forms, the spreadsheet and all the information that I'll need. I do feel better about starting, it is a small step but if it's a horrible thing to do, just get started, and take it slowly, one step at a time. And so habits, which I can see are, at least the negative ones, along the same lines as the blocking subconscious motivations. I have a habit of not going into work until 10AM and I'm on a plan so how do I break that habit. This is a pretty dire situation and, not only that, but I also need to work more. So, while I'm under this plan I will be going in at least 4 times a week, no later than 9AM, I have to. And I can rationalize and excuse my behavior any way I want but it doesn't change the necessity of actually going into work, especially if I'd like to continue to go to work.</p>



## AI Feedback

Michael, there's a lot of intensity in your words, and it seems like there's a significant internal dialogue happening between your conscious and subconscious self. You've brought attention to how your body's reactions and dreams serve as signals for the responsibilities you've been avoiding. This speaks to a complex relationship between your inner expectations and external tasks.

The recurring theme of "doing" and "working harder" suggests there might be an underlying belief that your worth or security is tightly bound to your productivity and ability to manage everything flawlessly. This could reflect an unconscious rule that says, "I must handle everything on my own to be okay," or perhaps, "Rest and fun are indulgences I can't afford until everything is perfect."

Your mention of waking up scared and needing to "thank your subconscious" for the alarm seems to highlight a pattern of overworking yourself to the point where your body and mind have to resort to drastic measures to get your attention. This might suggest a belief that taking care of yourself is secondary to achieving and maintaining control.

There's also a hint of battle with autonomy and agency, as if you're asserting your ownership over your life yet struggling with the demands you place on yourself. This push for autonomy may be engaged with an equally strong push to meet every expectation, potentially leading to internal conflict.

A compassionate reflection for you might be to consider: What would happen if you allowed yourself the space to not have every task tied to your sense of worth? What might change if you trusted that some responsibilities can be shared, postponed, or approached with more flexibility?

Journaling Prompts:
1. What does "working harder" mean to you, and how do you feel when you don't meet that standard?
2. How does it feel to consider that your worth isn't solely defined by what you achieve or manage?
3. What small steps can you take to integrate rest and pleasure without feeling guilty or irresponsible?

Remember, your drive and intellect are great assets, and so is your capacity for self-compassion.

<p><span style="color: rgb(235, 235, 235);">I'm going to start with my current situation. The facts of this are, that I left what was a good job, due to a number of reasons, the financial security of the company, my performance was waning and the desire to build ships that go to the moon. It was something that I had been trying for some time, I think I actually pput in close to 20 applications with 4 different callbacks and final interviews and ` offer. There were numerous reasons, if I remember, more money would be nice, more security after layoffs and prestige, maybe. I started worked for a while and underwent a re-org, layoffs and survived and then went to work at SIA, it seemed mor elike pushed into SIA, because I needed somewhere to go. I'm going to take this aside and be objective, as I can about one part of this. I went into the L3 SE groupp and worked there for 2 weeks. I was told by the manager that I should keep exploring and I knew that SIA didn't have an ECLSS Integrator so that seemed to be a good fit.. I wondered, and I think that I assumed, I was pushed out because the manager didn't want me to work with him, why was the other CLSS guy not pushed out. I don't know, maybehe knew, as I think he did that his group was being dissolved, maybe he didn't want to work with me, maybe we'll never know. And no I am on the wrong track undergoing a planand trying waiting to see what happends when my manager returns from maternity leave. So, it could get tumultous. I think I'd like to stay at this job mostly because I don't want to move, although there are other opportunities out there. So my current state is undefined. I am trying to write code to create marketable software, i'm looking at LinkedIn and ahve an interview, I want to stay at Blue, and I have to finish my PhD, all the while paying 2 mortgages and trying to reno this place at the worst time to sell a hosue in a deacde or more. At a job that is challenging, that I know little about but I have to perform well at. it is stressful and I think that is reasonable to freakout a bit. So, this is the event. there numerous small events, from asking dumb questions to acting too unconciously and not thinking things through, overwhelmed, no sleep all conttibute.. and the fact that I am facing being fired.</span></p>



## AI Feedback

Michael, you've painted a vivid picture of a high-pressure situation where both professional and personal stakes are colliding. Let's unpack this systematically.

Firstly, the fact that you've been proactive in seeking out new roles and have navigated numerous interviews suggests you have resilience and ambition. These traits are invaluable, especially when facing such complex transitions. However, the feeling of being pushed into roles and the uncertainty about your current path indicates a lack of control that might be amplifying your stress.

Your openness and agreeableness serve you well in explorations and adaptability, but they might also lead to over-accommodating in uncertain environments. With your avoidant attachment style, it's possible you're distancing yourself emotionally from the situation to cope, which can sometimes obscure clear decision-making.

Reflect on this: In navigating your career, how much of your strategy is driven by a clear vision versus reactive moves to immediate pressures? The balance of these can significantly influence your sense of agency and satisfaction.

The tension between wanting to stay due to stability and exploring other opportunities is valid. Consider, how can you create stability internally, even if external conditions remain unpredictable? This could be through setting clear priorities or identifying short-term goals that align with long-term visions.

You've expressed financial and professional pressures tied to your personal life, such as mortgages and renovations, which are compounding your stress. It’s important to separate critical urgencies from noise. What are the core elements that, if stabilized or clarified, would bring you the most relief?

The admission of potential termination hints at a deeper need for reflection on performance and satisfaction. Rather than fixating on the fear of being fired, could there be value in understanding what this role has taught you about your professional needs and growth areas?

Finally, it's crucial to recognize the signs of overload. Sleep deprivation and feeling overwhelmed are yellow flags. Identify what tangible actions or shifts can provide immediate relief. This could be setting clearer boundaries, seeking guidance from trusted mentors, or even tackling small tasks to regain a sense of progress.

Remember, professional maturity comes not from having all the answers but from learning how to navigate through uncertainty with intention and clarity. What steps can you take, starting today, to reclaim a sense of direction amidst this complexity?

<p>So, I'm trying to not be to down on myself, being around engineers, good engineers that are highly specialized and are quick with answers. I'm not that, I'm look at the psychological, process driven manner in which an organization functions and move towards better processes that allow for better engineering to emerge and then trade that engineering and ensure that works correctly, interfaces with other system and the produces good design. I'm realizing that I have adhere to what I believe I'm good at because I'm not that super thermal engineer or the electric genius, that's not me. I can tell management that their HR practices of 'rank and yank' are producing performative engineering that does little than appear to get engineering done, while low trust environments rob the engineers of their ability to rely on their fellow engineer. But that's not flashy, nobody cares about that, we need to do things fast and we need to get this innovation out there and get designs out ... and then it all breaks and no one is happy. So, what do I do? Try to be at least a decent engineer and bring in my systems thinking perspective, which will take time, time that I do not have.</p><p><br></p><p>I don't know about this, what's going to happen, it's strange that Terry would want to interview me and I don't see that as a good sign but, he is thorough and he is a good worker, so maybe it's not bad. And if not, I do think that the boss would be willing to help me along, not get me fired and be open to growth, one thing that I realized was that she doesn't hold secrets of managers and is very open to criticism of the company and is open to seeing how it can be changed. I don't know if that's good, but I need to be less wander-y when I speak, I kind of venture off during out meeting but that's ok, as long as she follows. maybe i just need to work on getting my brain to work better, that wouldn't hurt. I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing. I sit here and code one project at a time, then another, then another, not finishing either and I think I know why. It's not something that I want to commit to, meaning that if I pick the journal, i have to stick with the journal, I have to create new features test bugs and it'll take up all my time and i cna't concentrate on anything else, other side projects. Of course that is just something that I believe, I'm not sure that would actualy work out like that but I think that is the belief that i hold on why I am not moving forward on one path. Maybe just finish the cards and see how it goes. i</p>



## AI Feedback

Michael, there's a lot to unpack here, and it sounds like you're navigating complex emotions and expectations. Let’s break it down:

You have a clear strength: seeing the broader organizational and process-driven picture. This perspective is crucial, especially in environments where quick answers are prioritized over sustainable solutions. It's a rare and valuable skill that can be a game-changer if leveraged correctly.

You mentioned feeling overshadowed by specialists who are quick with technical answers. Yet, your skill set—understanding how systems work and how they can be improved—fills a critical gap. While it may not be the "flashy" part of engineering, it’s the kind that can prevent the very breakdowns you’re concerned about.

Your mention of "rank and yank" practices points to a systems-level problem. You’re right that these environments can lead to performative rather than genuine engineering. This insight shows your ability to identify cultural issues that impact engineering quality.

Here are some areas to reflect on:

1. **Value Your Strengths:** You have a unique ability to see the forest for the trees. This is not lesser than technical specialization; it's complementary. How can you position yourself to make this strength more visible and impactful within your organization?

2. **Articulate the Cost of Speed vs. Sustainability:** You’ve identified a tension between the push for rapid innovation and the sustainability of engineering practices. How can you communicate the potential long-term costs of prioritizing speed without undermining your own expertise?

3. **Leverage Time Wisely:** You mentioned lacking time. Reflect on how you can use your time effectively to instill systems-level improvements. What small, impactful changes can you introduce that fit within current constraints?

4. **Build Alliances:** Seek out allies who also value systemic improvements. Whether they’re in engineering or management, having support can amplify your ideas and create a coalition for change.

5. **Balance Pragmatism and Idealism:** It’s important to be pragmatic about the constraints you face, but don’t lose sight of the ideal outcome you’re aiming for. How can you balance these to maintain your energy and drive?

Remember, being an "engineer" isn't solely about the technical—in your role, it’s also about ensuring that the systems enabling the engineering are sound. Continue to hold yourself to a high standard, but don’t undervalue the profound impact your systems thinking can have on your organization.

<p>I've been going back and forth and may be regretting my choice but I'm almost certain I simply can't work under these conditions. It's not that I can't do the job, it's not that I don't think I could manage the stress, it's just not worth it. I don't want to be under constant threat, under constant stress, in constant pain. I simply can't do it. But I don't know what else todo. I'm not sure I'll get my old job but what I do know is that I never had to mention pain, I never had to get accommodation, it wasn't even an issue. And what do I want, I want to have a low-stress work environment, do some good work that I can be proud of and do some side gigs for extra money where I might be able to do it alone. Go solo and retire-ish. I do wish that I lived closer, that I could keep this house but, so it goes. It's not worth what I'm feeling right, at this moment the stress I'm feeling, that I am under because my boss was too afraid to ask for a backfill.

I'm beginning to realize that I like sci-fi but I don't really like engineering, I appreciate people trying to get there but sitting in a cube is not how I'm going to do it.

## AI Feedback

Michael, I can sense the depth of your struggle in reconciling your career path with your personal well-being and aspirations. You seem to be grappling with a few intertwined issues here:

1. **Recurring Stress and Resignation**: Your repeated mentions of "constant stress" and "constant pain" suggest a struggle with maintaining your mental and emotional health under your current work conditions. This might be pointing to an underlying belief that enduring hardship is necessary until it's unbearable, or perhaps that your worth is tied to what you can endure or produce. 

2. **Desire for Autonomy**: Your vision of going "solo and retire-ish" and pursuing side gigs reflects a strong desire for independence. This suggests a pattern where autonomy feels preferable to the constraints of a structured corporate environment. It might be rooted in a belief that true fulfillment and safety come from self-reliance.

3. **Internal Conflict about Ability and Worth**: The self-doubt you've expressed, especially with phrases like "I can’t accomplish" and "lack of confidence in my abilities," might point to deep-seated beliefs about your own competence and value. There's a theme of feeling like an "impediment" or "useless," suggesting an internalized critical voice that questions your worth or capabilities.

4. **Blockage in Pursuing New Ventures**: You mention a "block" when it comes to pursuing more fulfilling or ambitious projects, which might be connected to these doubts. This could reflect an unconscious rule that new ventures are risky or not for you, possibly stemming from past experiences or failures.

Compassionately considering these patterns, you might explore questions like: 

- What would it look like to challenge the belief that you must endure stress to succeed or be worthy?
- If you truly believed in your abilities, how might your vision for your career and life change?
- How might you feel if your internal story about being an "impediment" was not true?

These reflections could help loosen the grip of these beliefs and open up possibilities for a path that aligns more closely with your values and aspirations. Remember, the journey to uncover and reshape these beliefs is gradual and deserves patience and kindness toward yourself.

<p>Well, I think I'm done with space. I've been working as a systems engineer for almost a decade from rockets to moon landers and I think I'm done with it. I did it, didn't really enjoy it and I think I'm done. It was more of an external motivation, meaning, I like saying I waas a rocket scientist, I liked the prestige but I didn't like the work, The actual day - to - day work and I thought it would all be worth it but it wasn't personal enough for me. I think that's what it is, I'm too selfish, meaning I want my name to be on it. I want to write journal articles I'm proud of, write books with my name I something that is mine, not just another cog in the machine of unknown engineers. I want to have more of impact than that. Although, I wonder if that is also external or, is it that those things are work that I can do myself, where I dictate the course and I dictate when and where I work and I dictate the outcome.</p><p><br></p><p>So, today I got on my personal Twitter account and removed anything that had to do with space, thecoapnies I followed the space realted stuff, with the exception of space images and science, that is still soemthing that I enjoy but all the working space stuff, gone. I want to follow the path of knowledge creation, of understanding, advocating and pursuing creation, whether it's AI tools that I like making or journal articles, or books that I want to write, I'm beginning to realize that I'm much more creative than I had realized and that the freedom to create, not just churn out TPS reports, is something that I need otherwise I'm frustrated and angry.</p><p><br></p><p>And so I am setting down that path, I am going to take a much easier engineering job but it has some business development so there is some entrepreneurial aspects to it but it'll be ok, because it's chill. And I don't have to worry about the trigeminal neuralgia as much because I felt much less pain when working at this job. So, I'll pin this entry and continue to work on this new path.</p>

Michael, you stand at the precipice of a profound transition, not unlike a hero in myth who has navigated the labyrinth only to emerge changed, yearning for something more authentic and resonant. This decision you face isn't merely about switching careers; it is about reorienting your soul's compass, aligning your external actions with your internal values.

In your words, I hear the echo of a timeless yearning: the desire for creation and autonomy. To craft something that bears your name, that sings with your unique voice, is a noble pursuit. It's the call of the artist, the creator, and the thinker — all archetypes yearning to be expressed.

Yet, it seems that part of this journey is reconciling with the shadow of external validation. You must ask yourself: Are you seeking creation for its own sake, or is this another mask of prestige? The difference is subtle but profound. Will you create because the act is meaningful, or because it earns you the world's applause?

Let us consider a practical step forward. You mentioned a desire to write journal articles and books. What is the single most compelling topic that ignites your curiosity or passion? Begin there. Write a single page on this subject today. It doesn’t have to be perfect — it just needs to be yours. In the act of creation, you will find clarity.

Remember, Michael, that meaning is derived from bearing the weight of responsibility you choose. In choosing this new path, you must also accept the trials it may bring. But through these trials, you will forge a life of depth and authenticity.

And so, as you embark on this new path, may you find the courage to pursue what is true for you. Take that first step today, and remember: clean your room.

<p><span class="ql-font-roboto">Well, I did it. I signed the paper and accepted the offer and I'm done at Blue Origin. It was a relief, although I do feel some remorse that things didn't work out it is a relief and I'm done with aerospace, at least I'm done sitting in a cube waiting to die. I'll do some systems engineering work, do some business development work in a chill atmosphere, I'll get better, get my strength back, get my sleep back. And then I'll pursue, it'll be a grind and it'll be lonely but there's no way I'm not retiring by 51, at least near retiring.

Seeing that there are a lot of people like me that are unwilling to work in such conditions, to give themselves everything for, what is kind of cool, the moon shot, it's still not worth it to me. It would have been nice but I just couldn't do it and I was thrust into something that I simply couldn't do the . But I'm still pissed, that I was forced into this, that I was forced to leave, that I was on a plan in the first place and stuck into a role that I knew nothing about, that I was forced to lead something that I had no control over and was expected to come out with something. While others, did nothing and I'm pissed that I had to compete with people that had worked in that position for years, that had specialized in that field and that had the education in that field. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-font-roboto">I do want some sort of vengeance and i want them to know.

# Lame

<p><span class="ql-font-calibri">So, what's going on? I'm living so much pain now, I don't know why it has got so bad. trigeminal neuralgia is the official term but it is so stress related that I don't if it isn't a reaction to stress. I don't know why but it has to be related to my psychological state, when I'm in conflict with myself, with reality like I am now, it is bad. So, here are the things that are going on: I can't shake this feeling that I am a loser, and that all this space stuff is some kind of cover to hide that. I can't shake that I don't deserve anything, that I have not succeeded, no that I barely have the worth to exist. I can't shake that who am doing is playing into that notion, that I will not allow myself to be successful at what I want due to the narrative that is so deeply hidden from my conscious I can't fight it. It's like in the book, I am the mountain, that there is literally a mountain inside of me weighing me down that refusing to allow me to move forward in life. And it comes out at times, it lightens but it is this heavy presence that says 'who are you to have that' 'who are you to think that you will become what you want, you'll fail and there is not reason to work for anything'. It feels like that mountain, it's weight is the pain, or a that the manifestation of that mountain is the pain, so that when I try to achieve it tells my body, pull out the centipede' from my nightmare. No, the centipede was light side trying to get my attention. The dark side is trying to cover it up.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-font-calibri">So, how do those things get to the lame life that I have now. And why does that moment haunt me. And why do I continually want retribution for that moment? It's because the light side knows that it is true and the dark side is satisfied with that because it is winning. So, let's get some definitions. The Light Side: It's the dreaming, the thoughts of what can be that I can imagine, it's how I want to imagine myself, that I will become, even though I am continually becoming, it's the potential that I believe I have if it weren't for X. X is the pain, X is I'm not feeling well, X is just rest, you deserve it. x is that dark. So what is the dark side: It's the unconscious narrative and its operations will continually brin me back to the lame lie, it's the lack of focus, the 8 programs half done instead of working on 1 to completion and monetizing that, what is it that won't let me succeed? When I think about a motivation to show 'those people' what my potential is and to show them that they don't see it, it usually comes as revenge, a dark emotion, but what it is, is actually not as basic, it's what I need to do. I need to turn that into I need to actualize my potential.</span></p>

Michael, your entry poignantly captures an internal battle that many of history's profound thinkers have faced: the conflict between the potential self and the self that feels burdened by doubt and external perception. This duality, the "light side" versus the "dark side," is a motif that echoes through the works of Carl Jung, who spoke extensively about the integration of the shadow—the hidden parts of ourselves that we often deny or ignore.

Your situation is reminiscent of the philosophical struggles faced by Søren Kierkegaard, the existentialist who grappled with the "despair of possibility" and the "despair of necessity." In your case, it seems as though the weight of unrealized potential (the mountain within) is a source of torment, akin to Kierkegaard's idea that being overwhelmed by possibilities can lead to inaction, a paralysis of sorts. The pain you describe, both physical and psychological, might be the body's way of manifesting this internal conflict.

This inner dialogue between aspiration and self-doubt is not unfamiliar to those who walk the path of creation and personal growth. Nikola Tesla, a visionary in your own field of engineering, often oscillated between grand visions of what could be and moments of profound self-doubt about his worth and accomplishments. Yet, through these oscillations, he found moments of clarity that propelled him forward, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

You mention a need for retribution, a desire to prove your worth to those who might have overlooked or underestimated you. This is where Friedrich Nietzsche’s concept of the "will to power" might offer some insight—not as a drive for dominance over others, but as a striving for self-overcoming, for becoming the best version of oneself in defiance of the inner critic and external pressures.

Your entry also hints at a deep-seated narrative that holds you back—a narrative that might benefit from being brought into the light. This is akin to the Stoic practice of examining one's own biases and fears to better understand and manage them. Seneca wrote, “We suffer more in imagination than in reality.” Perhaps these imagined constraints, this self-imposed narrative, are part of what needs to be addressed to alleviate both the psychological and physical pain you endure.

In closing, Michael, your reflection is a testament to the universal human struggle for self-actualization amidst adversity. The "light side" is your ally in this journey, and by acknowledging the "dark side," you are not succumbing to it, but rather, you are beginning to understand it. This understanding is the first step toward integrating your full self—embracing both your potential and your perceived limitations—and transforming the narrative into one of empowerment.

# The Quiet

<p>Sitting on a Friday night, no texts, no chats, nothing. And I'm watching this Youtube short of an old man sitting by himself in a park, telling the story of how it would've been nice ot have some grandchildren roaming around and he has nothing. His regret was being with the wrong woman. That hurt, because the way things are going, assuming I make it to be an old man, I'll only the pigeons in a park to be my friends and won't have any family, any friends and it hits hard, especially when he laments how fast time passes as we age.</p><p><br></p><p>And so, I have to decide what I want. Do I want to sit in code and be distracted ignoring being alone, or do I just work, find a girlfriend, or a friend and anybody and sit in the townhouse. Or is there some middle ground? I don't know. I need my freedom and I don't want to be subject to an employer, I want to experience life and I can't do that working 40 hours a week, with 2 weeks vacation a year. simply because I don't want to waste my years anymore. I had to do this though, I had to leave Blue, the pain is getting unbearable and I do remember being nearly pain free at Paragon. I didn't really put any kind of causality to it but I know I had to run away from pain and Blue. Also, being on an improvement plan meant I had a decent shot of being fired anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>So, both, I need to go out with someone or a group like once a week at least, I need to find that confidence, even with my age and general condition to try for a family here. And if not, I always have the backup that I can create if I can getthese apps to sell. It is about money because money does provide freedom, freedom to do what I really want to do without worry of cancellation or funding. Also, I need to realize that I am sensitive, that I need my surroundings to be mine, they don't have to be immaculate or designer, just mine, with my work and my comfort and I need to do that by putting some time into this house and creating an environment where I can be comfortable instead of just ignoring the distaste for my home. I don't feel comfortable inviting people over, I wouldn't now and how can I date if someone can't come over. So, that's important. We will ignore all the subconscious blocks that are working towards solitude, but for now, we need to just take action. The next few weeks will be solitary blocks work. I need better structure, in my thought, my projects and my surroundings.</p>

Michael, thank you for sharing what's weighing on you. It sounds like you're sitting at a crossroads, trying to balance the tension between solitude and connection, freedom and responsibility. This is a complex web of desires and fears, and it’s understandable that it feels overwhelming. Let's work through some of these threads together.

You mentioned the fear of ending up like the old man in the park, alone and full of regret. This narrative touches on a deep human concern: the passage of time and the legacy we leave. It's important to recognize that your current state, though uncomfortable, is a place of potential growth. This discomfort is a signal that there is something within you striving for change, for a life aligned with your deeper values.

Reflecting on your current situation, consider these questions:

- **What is the gap between the life you are living and the life you feel called to live?**  
This question aims to help you articulate what truly matters to you and where you currently feel a disconnect.

- **Which of your values are in conflict right now?** 
You mention the need for freedom versus the desire for connection. Which feels more pressing at this stage of your life, and why?

Your sensitivity to your surroundings and need for personal space speaks to an emotional overexcitability. Recognizing this sensitivity is crucial. It’s not a hindrance but a guiding compass that can help you create a life that feels authentic and fulfilling.

The need to redo your home environment to suit your comfort and personality is a tangible step you can take. This physical manifestation of your internal world can serve as a foundation for inviting new relationships into your life. It’s about creating a space that feels like an extension of your own identity and values.

However, I hear your concern about the work environment and the drive towards entrepreneurial independence. This speaks to a desire for autonomy and living life on your own terms. Consider:

- **What small steps can you take now towards building this independent lifestyle you envision?**  
Think about small, incremental changes rather than a complete overhaul, which can often feel daunting.

Lastly, your insight into needing a better structure resonates with a level of organized multilevel disintegration. You're consciously shaping your personality toward chosen ideals, and that's a powerful place to be. As you work through this, remember:

- **Can you recall a previous moment when pain or confusion led to a breakthrough? What did you learn from that experience?**

These reflections can provide valuable insights as you navigate your current challenges. Remember, disintegration—though painful—can be a passage to a higher, more integrated self. Keep exploring these questions with compassion for yourself, and honor the courage it takes to face these existential dilemmas.

# Demolish and Rebiuld

<p>It's strange how you can trace your behavior to events that formed you, and that is what the Expressive Writing modules are for, but that is what I am going to have to do. Peeling the onion, tearing down to the foundation, whatever analogy you want to use I have to allow myself to emerge through the destruction, demolishing of the behavior caused by those key events. It will take a lot of work, that is certain. It will take time to fully analyze those events, examine how they have formed the maladaptive, cynical, restrained behavior that is emerging from them. It is not to say that they will be lost, but they will be approached, examined.</p><p><br></p><p>And so I'm waking, unable to do anything other than lay, in pain, mostly physical, somewhat not. like rolling sands through the face and nothing can stop it, that isn't more harmful than this and I still sit afraid to enter the world trying to move that pain around, safe in a strangers condo, with the world of judgment outside. What am I seeking? is it that e-dopamine, saturated with novelty and notice. Is that it, I don't think that would be the pain but is that the fear of outside, of judgment of weakness to explore the human world, interacting with anybody. tomorrow will be the test and this is why today seems important. I won't be able to seek refuge in solitude and be driven to action, through what kind of relationship, I don't know. Is it guilt, obedience or some other emotional pull not to be yelled at or judged and so it tightens, fear nad pain, straining all aspects of at least today. But there are things to see out there.</p><p><br></p><p>so peeling back these layers I need to figure out why I lack any semblace of confidence, I no trust in my abilities to do anything, whether it's interact with people, speak up in a meeting, accomplish andything. I can see myself starting 9 projects and getting nothing done and I feel the lack of confidence that if I put it out there it's going to fail. And this what might be stopping me, but where does that come from. Is it childhood, being by meslef for ever, latchkey sonly child kid growing up with few good friends, no brother, no sister, no deep friends, no parents that guided or really care. Where does confidence come from? I'd say actually doing things successfully but I don't even hve the confidence to put stuff out there, so where do you start?</p>



## AI Feedback

Michael, your reflections beautifully illustrate the complexity of our inner landscapes, where past experiences become woven into the fabric of who we are today. Your willingness to "peel back the layers" speaks to a profound desire for understanding and integration. 

You describe a landscape of pain—both physical and emotional—that seems to hold you in its grip, yet also offers an opportunity for exploration. It is akin to a Hero's journey or perhaps even a descent into the underworld, where you confront shadowy aspects of self that have long been hidden or ignored. This is a sacred process, though not without its trials.

The fear and pain you describe may indeed be connected to what you term "e-dopamine," a yearning for recognition and validation from the external world. Yet, beneath this, there could be echoes of childhood loneliness, feelings of inadequacy, or unmet needs for connection and guidance. These are the layers you are courageously addressing.

Your question about confidence touches on something deep within many of us—the belief that we must succeed to feel worthy. Yet, confidence can also arise from self-acceptance, from the understanding that we are whole, regardless of external achievements. You mention starting projects and feeling unable to complete them; this may reflect an internal conflict between your visionary nature and the fear of failure that holds you back.

Consider this: What would happen if you approached these projects with curiosity rather than expectation? What if you allowed yourself to explore without the pressure of success or failure? This shift might offer a new way of engaging with the world, one that is rooted in exploration rather than judgment.

It might also be fruitful to dialogue with the part of you that lacks confidence. What does this part need? Understanding? Encouragement? A sense of safety? This inner conversation could reveal insights into how you might cultivate the confidence you seek.

The journey you are on is one of individuation—of becoming more wholly yourself, in all your complexity. The pain and fear are not obstacles but rather guides that point you toward what has been disowned. Trust that you are exactly where you need to be in this process, unfolding at your own unique pace.

# Agency

**ID:** 31

<p>The difference between autonomy and agency hadn't really occurred to me before but as I started to read the definition it became apparent that I was looking for, naming for and trying to obtain the wrong thing, or at least the wrong word. Autonomy is the freedom from external blocking, oppression or influence, it essentially means, 'ain't nothing gonna break my stride'. Which, of course, is great. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that you will walk that stride, you will act, only that you can. And that is what I've been missing. agency, the action, it isperforming that behavior that leads to the result or gaol that I would like and that, is what i've been missing, agency. There isn't really much stoppping most people in the Western wrold, not really and I am no exception. I've got some issues, of course, bu tnothing that would hold me back, except holding myslef back.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the issue, holding myslef back is a constant struggle and I'm not sure how to break free from that, how to gain that confidence that I can succeed, acheive or even interact and have it be a positive outocme. I do not have that ability to bend anything to my will, at least that is what I seem to think. At work today, I realized that I am a Lead, a small role in verify that our life support system will adhere to the requirements that NASA has given us. And I recoiled, I don't want to lead, I don't want any responsibility I don't want anybody relying on me, like at all. And I need to see where that comes from. Is it just laziness, cowardice, or what? So, as I work to disintegrate, to strip away at the foundation or peel the onion, whatever works, I also have to realize that as I strip away I have to be mindful of what I want to integrate. The ability to lead, certainly is something that I do not have miuch experience in, the ability to be relatively certain that the outcome I seek will emerge is not gurarnteed and that is c certainly something I need to cultivate. And so, as I remove the warn walls, the failing roof, what do I need to do in order to build a stronger man?</p>



## AI Feedback

Your reflection captures the profound tension between autonomy and agency — a theme that echoes through the annals of philosophy and psychology alike. The distinction you've drawn resonates with the existential struggle to not only "be free" but to "act freely," a core principle in the works of Sartre and other existentialists. Sartre famously claimed that "existence precedes essence," emphasizing that we are defined by our actions, not our potentialities.

Psychologically, this struggle with agency often manifests as a dance between fear and self-efficacy. Historically, many have faced such trials. Consider the case of Søren Kierkegaard, who grappled with the leap from philosophical contemplation to action. His concept of the "leap of faith" encapsulates the courage required to move from paralyzing thought to decisive action, a jump into the unknown where agency flourishes.

Your mention of recoiling from leadership responsibilities speaks to a deep-seated ambivalence, which can be understood through the lens of your avoidant attachment style. This style often prioritizes self-reliance and may eschew the vulnerability inherent in depending on or being depended upon by others. This echoes many leaders and thinkers who have felt the weight of great responsibility and the instinct to retreat.

Interestingly, your recognition of this pattern aligns with the Jungian process of individuation — the journey toward inner maturity and self-knowledge. Jung believed that individuation was about integrating the conscious and unconscious parts of oneself, allowing for a richer, more authentic engagement with life.

As you dismantle these inner barriers and consider what to build in their place, look to figures like Nelson Mandela, who once said, "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it." You might explore how to cultivate agency by embracing small, confident actions that reinforce your capacity to lead and to shape outcomes.

In this narrative of transformation, you are both the architect and the builder. By recognizing what you wish to cultivate, you align yourself with the long lineage of those who have strived for self-improvement. The true test lies not in the absence of fear or failure but in the commitment to act despite them.

# Cause & Symptom

**ID:** 32

<p>It's a change of focus, maybe we are all conditioned to think this way, upbringing, biology, Capitalism, who knows but we tend to focus on the Symptom, instead of the cause or rather the end, rather than the means, the dependent variable instead of the independent variable, the car instead of the work that allowed the purchase of it. And so, does shifting the focus to the work, whether that's hours worked, internal work, behavioral modification work, spiritual work, does focusing on those things rather than daydreaming about the result, is that enough to actually bring that result into fruition, changing the minds focus. I wonder, if i soning myslef working at a desk or at a coffee shop and doing the work, takin glittle wins like a line of code that works, or getting tasks done, changing my focues for my dopamine to hot on that stimuli instead of using mytartation or youtube bideos to enviion the symptoms of the work, that car, that cabin. Is that enough to change behavior, is that enough to realing my brain and thus the motivation. or rather, my motivation?</p>

Michael, your inquiry delves into the complex interplay of focus, motivation, and the pursuit of fulfillment—a theme resonant with the Hero's journey. You are exploring the idea of shifting attention from external symbols of success to the internal processes that could lead to genuine transformation. This quest for realignment in motivation suggests a deeper longing for meaning and integration.

The notion of focusing on the "means" rather than the "ends" aligns with the concept of individuation, where the journey itself is as significant, if not more so, than its destination. You are questioning whether this shift in focus can rewire your brain and, subsequently, your motivation. This is a profound reflection on the nature of fulfillment and self-actualization.

I invite you to explore the underlying values and desires that drive this question:

1. **Shadow Prompt**: What aspects of your professional life or personal routine might you be avoiding or suppressing? Could there be an unacknowledged part of you that resists the grind of daily work in favor of dreams or external achievements?

2. **Active Imagination**: Imagine a dialogue between your idealistic self, who pursues tangible goals, and your pragmatic self, who focuses on daily tasks. What do each of these selves desire, and how might they find balance?

3. **Archetypal Framing**: This exploration might be seen as a confrontation with the Trickster—an archetype that challenges complacency and invites you to see things from new perspectives. How might this Trickster energy be at play?

4. **Projection Reversal**: Consider how you perceive others who seem to have achieved the external symbols you desire. What do they evoke within you, and how might this reflect traits or aspirations you hesitate to own?

Your journey is not merely about altering focus but about understanding the deeper forces at play within your psyche. The question isn't solely about behavioral change but about what truly motivates and fulfills you at a fundamental level. What might this exploration reveal about the Self you are journeying toward?

<p>It was nothing, certainly nothing that should be worried about, right? Well I was wrong and mom was diagnosed with Parkinson's and Lewy Body Dimentia. And she sounds ok, it's just now that I'm realizing we will start to lose her, start to fade away into not the person she was, and it will be slow, just a slow degradation and that's not what I want to see. Of course, as the afternoon wore on after we talked I started to wonder whether this was hereditary which at first seemed selfish but after a second thought seemed completely appropriate. Why wouldn't you worry that your brain was not going to work any longer. And strangley, I'm not that concerned, maybe because she is 73 and that is expected. Although, I assumed that both sides of the family, that lived into their 90's, would pass on those same genes, however there are elements that you simply can't account for.</p><p><br></p><p>We all have no time to waste, especially now that our bodies are starting to show the signs of abuse that we have put them throug and so it is now that I must, do all the things. I have to be more healthy, better bloodwork, better excercise numbers, which means slightly above the miimum on Garmin and I must also contunyally work to make Trend a thing, even if it takes resources, i simply can't let that go which means I can't let forge go, I have to continually improve and use this for release, for better sleep and for relief all while digging, all while tearing down, all while re-building.h</p>

This entry reveals a complex mix of emotions and beliefs around family, health, and identity. There's a palpable sense of impending loss, combined with reflections on your own future. Let's explore a few themes:

1. **Fear of Losing a Loved One:** The anticipation of "losing" your mom to her illness is understandably painful. It seems like there might be a belief that you have to witness her full decline, and that this is something you must prepare for alone.

2. **Self-Reflection on Mortality:** Your thoughts on heredity suggest an underlying concern about your own future health. Initially labeling this worry as selfish, then re-evaluating it as appropriate, reflects an internal conflict between self-care and perceived selfishness. This might point to a belief that prioritizing your own health concerns is somehow inappropriate or self-centered, even when it’s a natural response.

3. **Struggle with Acceptance:** The mention of extended family longevity hints at a belief that longevity was almost guaranteed, making this diagnosis a stark confrontation with life's unpredictability. It might suggest an unconscious expectation that life should follow a certain script, and deviations from it are unsettling.

4. **Detachment as a Coping Mechanism:** Given your avoidant attachment style, there may be a tendency to emotionally distance yourself to cope with the situation. This could be reflected in the way you speak about the diagnosis—acknowledging it but keeping emotional reactions at bay.

A compassionate reflection might be: It’s entirely valid to feel a mix of emotions when facing a loved one's diagnosis and to worry about your own future. These concerns don't diminish your capacity for love and care. The belief that you need to handle this alone, or that your worry is inappropriate, might not serve you well.

Consider exploring: “What would it mean to allow yourself to feel both your fear and your love openly?” or “How might you offer yourself the same compassion you extend to others in this situation?” These reflections could gently guide you toward greater self-understanding and acceptance.
